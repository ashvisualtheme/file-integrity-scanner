## `[1.3.0.0]` - 2025-10-31

### âœ¨ Compatibility

Open Journal Systems (OJS) 3.3.x

### ðŸš€ Added

- **Monitored Exclusions**: The system now actively monitors critical files like `config.inc.php` and the `public/` directory for any changes, additions, or deletions, and reports these activities.
- **Orphaned Cache Cleanup**: A new function to automatically detect and remove outdated cache files left behind from previous application versions or uninstalled plugins.
- **"All Clear" Notifications**: The system will now send an email notification even when no issues are found, confirming that the scan completed successfully.
- **Enhanced Email Reports**: Email reports are now more detailed, with clear descriptions for each category of issue and a dedicated section for reporting changes to monitored files.

### ðŸ”§ Changed

- **Exclusion Logic Overhaul**: The method for excluding files has been completely revised, now distinguishing between "Permanent Exclusions" (e.g., `cache/`) which are never scanned, and "Monitored Exclusions" which are watched for changes.
- **Improved Email Structure**: The content and structure of the notification email have been significantly improved for better readability and clarity.

### ðŸ”’ Security

- **Hardened Baseline Fetching**: The connection to GitHub for downloading hash baselines now enforces stricter SSL/TLS verification to protect against potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Secure Cache Integrity**: All cache files are now signed with an HMAC hash to ensure the integrity of the cache and prevent tampering.
- **Stricter File Permissions**: Cache files and directories are now created with more secure file permissions (`0600` for files, `0700` for directories) to restrict access.
- **Improved Baseline Validation**: Downloaded baseline files are now validated to ensure correct JSON formatting and hash data, preventing errors from corrupted files.

### ðŸš€ Key features

- **Core File Integrity Scanning**: Introduced the core functionality to scan and compare installation files against official checksums to detect changes.
