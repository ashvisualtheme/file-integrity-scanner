# üõ°Ô∏è File Integrity Scanner Plugin for OJS 3.x

## **Uncompromising Security for Your OJS Installation**

This essential plugin dramatically strengthens your OJS security posture by proactively scanning your core application and plugin files. It uses **cryptographic hash comparison** against known official baselines to instantly detect unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions that could signal file corruption or a security breach.

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üïµÔ∏è **Proactive Change Detection** | Automatically calculates local **SHA256 hashes** and compares them to the official, version-specific baselines stored remotely.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| üéØ **Pinpoint Accuracy**          | Validates integrity for both the **OJS Core files** and individual **Plugins**, ensuring nothing is left unchecked.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| üìß **Critical Alerts**            | Sends a detailed email notification to the site contact address, summarizing all detected files that were **Modified**, **Added**, or **Deleted** (both against the official baseline and for locally monitored files).                                                                                              |
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Scheduled Automation**       | Registers a task to run a full integrity scan automatically **once every 24 hours**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ‚ú® **Smart Cache System**         | Caches hash baselines for efficiency and **automatically cleans up orphaned and outdated cache files** after OJS or plugin upgrades, ensuring fresh baselines are always used.                                                                                                                                       |
| üìù **Manual Excludes**            | Allows administrators to specify a list of files or directories to be **monitored for local changes but excluded from baseline comparison**. This helps reduce false positives from intentional modifications (e.g., `config.inc.php`) while still alerting you to any unauthorized changes to these critical files. |

### **üîç Detected Security Issue Types**

The scan precisely identifies three types of deviations from the official baseline:

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Modified:** A file exists, but its hash does not match the official baseline (indicates a change or corruption).
- **üö® Added:** A file exists locally but is **not** present in the official baseline (a potential indicator of malicious file uploads).
- **‚ùå Deleted:** A file present in the official baseline is missing from the local installation (potential file system corruption or removal by an attacker).

##

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Monitored Modified:** A file explicitly excluded from baseline comparison (e.g., `config.inc.php` or a manually excluded file) has changed locally since the last scan.
- **üö® Monitored Added:** A new file has been found within a directory that is explicitly excluded from baseline comparison (e.g., a new file in `public/` or a manually excluded directory).
- **‚ùå Monitored Deleted:** A file previously present in a locally monitored exclusion list is now missing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Installation

### System Requirements

- **OJS version:** **3.x and above** (requires PKP library scheduled task support).
- **PHP:** Must support the `hash_file('sha256', ...)` and `file_get_contents(...)` functions to download remote JSON files.

### Installation in 5 Simple Steps

1.  ‚¨áÔ∏è Download the latest release from the plugin's release page.
2.  üîë Log in to your OJS dashboard as a **Site Administrator**.
3.  ‚û°Ô∏è Navigate to **Website Settings > Plugins > Upload a New Plugin**.
4.  üì§ Upload the downloaded `.tar.gz` file.
5.  ‚úÖ Once installation is complete, **enable** the plugin under the **Generic Plugins** tab.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Administration

The plugin is designed for automated security, but administrators retain full control over immediate actions and cache management.

### **Automatic Daily Schedule**

The integrity scan runs automatically **once per day** using the OJS scheduled tasks feature (Acron plugin).

- You will **only receive an email notification** if the scan detects any file changes. If your file system is clean, **no email** is sent.

### **Manual Actions (Instant Control)**

1.  Navigate to **Website Settings > Plugins**.
2.  Find the **File Integrity Plugin** and click the actions arrow.
3.  You have two powerful actions:
    - **‚ö° Run Manual Scan:** Instantly execute a full, on-demand scan. This is ideal after major updates or when suspicious activity is suspected.
    - **üóëÔ∏è Clear Hash Cache:** Deletes all cached baseline JSON files. While the plugin **automatically removes outdated cache files** after software upgrades, this manual action is useful if you suspect the cache is corrupt or want to force a fresh download for all items on the next scan.

### **Configuring Settings (Manual Excludes)**

You can configure the plugin to ignore specific files or directories that you have intentionally modified.

1.  Navigate to **Website Settings > Plugins**.
2.  Find the **File Integrity Plugin** and click the actions arrow, then select **Settings**.
3.  In the **Manual Excludes** text area, enter the paths of files or directories you wish to exclude, one path per line. Paths should be relative to your OJS root directory (e.g., `config.inc.php` or `plugins/generic/myCustomPlugin`).
4.  Click **Save**. These paths will now be ignored in all future scans.
